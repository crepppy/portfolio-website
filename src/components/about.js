                        <p>Hi, I’m Jack (formerly crepppy), a 16 year-old developer from the UK. I have been working
                            with Java for 4 years as a freelancer offering a variety of services including Minecraft 
                            plugins and Discord bots. For the past 2 years, I have also spent time working with clients 
                            creating Python automation scripts and full-stack web applications.</p>
                        <p>When you hire me, you can expect an active and experienced developer that can fulfil your 
	    		    request at a fair price with an efficient and organised approach.</p>
