                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jack, a 15 year-old developer from the UK. I have been working with Java for 4 years
                        offering a variety of affordable services including Minecraft plugins and Discord bots. For the
                        past 2 years, I have spent time working with clients creating Python scripts and full-stack web
                        applications.</p>
                    <p>When you hire me, you can expect an active and experienced developer that can fulfil almost any
                        request at an affordable price with an efficient and organised approach.</p>
