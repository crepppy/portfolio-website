                        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Jack (formerly crepppy), a 16 year-old developer from the UK. I have been working
                            with Java for 4 years as a freelancer offering a variety of services including,
                            but not limited to, Minecraft plugins and Discord bots. For the past 2 years, I have spent
                            time working with clients creating Python automation scripts and full-stack web
                            applications.</p>
                        <p>When you hire me, you can expect an active and experienced developer that can fulfil your 
	    		    request at an affordable price with an efficient and organised approach.</p>
